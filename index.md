# Learning: Bitsy

In this unit you will be creating a game with Bitsy (https://medium.com/@cavegift/https-medium-com-cavegift-bitsy-is-a-tiny-toolset-4016814c5367). It is a simple, yet suprising game making tool that has the potential to create powerful interactive experiences 

## The Lesson Prompt

As you are creating advesnture game in this exercise, you will be designing enrvironments with chracters. Bitsy is an application that utilizes room-based screens for constructing environments. You will be working with the constraints of a limited color palette and pixel grid. As you work with these limitations, you can consider the following:

- **Pixel Grid** - Every room, character, and object are built using tiles. Rooms are defined by a 16 x 16 tile grid for conveying environments. The characters and obejcts are organized into the "avatar," "tile," "sprite," and "item" tabs in the "paint" category in Bitsy's options. The for afoementioned tabs all utilize a smaller 8 x 8 tile grid for expressing your ideas. 

- **Color** - Bitsy allows one color each for backgrounds, tiles ,and sprites. However, the amount of colors you can choose from for your total of three displayed colors are selectable from a color wheel that allows a great variety of hues and shadows. Think abbout how colors can create moods for your provided environments/

- **Text** - Though Bitsy integrates graphics for artistic expression, text-based dialogue is an integral aspewct of creating works in Bitsy. Think about how your color choices and environments flow with your text-based dialogues.

## Sharing on your process

When you complete your Bitsy adventure, you will post it to the class discussion board on canvas. In your post, you will share your process in completing your game. As you do this, you can talk about your inspirations and influences for creating your project. You will be required to respond to at least one other student after interacting with their work.
